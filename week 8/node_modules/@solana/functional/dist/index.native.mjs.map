This is useful when building up a transaction message.\n *\n * Until the [pipeline operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator) becomes part of JavaScript you can use this utility to create pipelines.\n *\n * Following common implementations of pipe functions that use TypeScript, this function supports a maximum arity of 10 for type safety.\n *\n * Note you can use nested pipes to extend this limitation, like so:\n * ```ts\n * const myValue = pipe(\n *      pipe(\n *          1,\n *          (x) => x + 1,\n *          (x) => x * 2,\n *          (x) => x - 1,\n *      ),\n *      (y) => y / 3,\n *      (y) => y + 1,\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * @see https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/master/source/pipe.js\n * @see https://github.com/darky/rocket-pipes/blob/master/index.ts\n *\n * @example Basic\n * ```ts\n * const add = (a, b) => a + b;\n * const add10 = x => add(x, 10);\n * const add100 = x => add(x, 100);\n * const sum = pipe(1, add10, add100);\n * sum === 111; // true\n * ```\n *\n * @example Building a Solana transaction message\n * ```ts\n * const transferTransactionMessage = pipe(\n *     // The result of the first expression...\n *     createTransactionMessage({ version: 0 }),\n *     // ...gets passed as the sole argument to the next function in the pipeline.\n *     tx => setTransactionMessageFeePayer(myAddress, tx),\n *     // The return value of that function gets passed to the next...\n *     tx => setTransactionMessageLifetimeUsingBlockhash(latestBlockhash, tx),\n *     // ...and so on.\n *     tx => appendTransactionMessageInstruction(createTransferInstruction(myAddress, toAddress, amountInLamports), tx),\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * @returns The initial value\n */\nexport function pipe<TInitial>(\n
